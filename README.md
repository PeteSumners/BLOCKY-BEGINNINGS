📜 BLOCKY BEGINNINGS: THE "KINDA-SORTA" RPG PLUGIN MANUAL 📜
🌟 What's This Thing?
Welcome to Blocky Beginnings! It's an RPG plugin for Minecraft 1.21 using Spigot. Think of it as a level 1 character - not very impressive yet, but oh boy, the places we'll go!
🔨 What Can It Do? (Don't Get Too Excited)

🎭 Pick Your Fighter: Be a Warrior or Mage. Revolutionary, we know.
✨ Do Cool Stuff: One whole skill per class. Try not to overwhelm yourself.
🌠 Always-On Awesomeness: Each class gets a permanent effect. It's like deodorant, but magical.

🗣️ Magic Words (Commands)

/chooseclass <classname>: Warrior or Mage? Decisions, decisions...
/useskill: Do the thing your class does!

👥 Meet the Cast

💪 Warrior

Always Buff: Strength I, for opening tough pickle jars
Hulk Out: Berserker Rage (Strength II for 10 seconds, then a 60-second nap)


🧙 Mage

Night Owl: Permanent Night Vision, for reading spellbooks after bedtime
Fireball Frenzy: Launch fireballs every 10 seconds. Safety goggles not included.



🔧 Nerdy Bits

Runs on Spigot/MC 1.21, because we're not cavemen
Uses Bukkit API, like every other plugin ever
Stores data in a HashMap, because we took a CS class once

🚀 Coming Soon(ish)
We've got big dreams:

More classes (maybe even THREE!)
Leveling system (numbers go up, dopamine goes brrr)
Custom mobs (probably just chickens with hats)
Crafting (glue a stick to a rock, call it a sword)
Quests and dungeons (fetch quests, fetch quests everywhere)
Prestige system (start over, but with a shiny badge)

Remember, this plugin is like a Minecraft dirt house - it ain't much, but it's honest work. With your brilliant ideas and my mediocre coding, we'll turn it into a diamond castle in no time! Let's make some blocky magic happen! 🏰🗡️🧙‍♂️
